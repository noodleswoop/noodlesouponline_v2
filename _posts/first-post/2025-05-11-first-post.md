Hello. My name is Rachel. This is my first post on my website. Many hours were spent figuring out how to set this up, and rediscovering my extremely rusty frontend web dev skills.

I can't quite say for certain what, if any, central topic this blog will have. My interests are many and varied, so I'll go ahead and label it as a digital commonplace book slash notepad slash travel diary. I'm hoping to use this as a way to get in the habit of articulating my thoughts more. Also as a way to keep myself accountable in my never-ending quest for self-edification. 

I hope you enjoy your stay.
